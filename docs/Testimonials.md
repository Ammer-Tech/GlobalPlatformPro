# Feedback from users

Both developers and end-users like the simplicity and usability of GlobalPlatformPro. Here are some testimonials.

> We have been using gpshell to manipulate contents of JCOP cards but we needed something that works with new smart cards / protocols and also something we can  integrate with our PC/SC stack. We tried GlobalPlatformPro and we never looked  back. We can easily tweak bits we need - like a command line switch for our PC/SC TerminalFactory.

> We are very happy with this tool. Well done Martin, thanks!

> I've just been trying out your latest version and it certainly lives up to your claims. It is very much easier to use than GPShell and does a much better job of detecting card and key information automatically.
